#if_else statements
"""
In programming just similar to our daily life we need to perform various decision making based on certain conditions for which we use 
conditional statements and there are three types of conditional statements in python programming :
1- if
2- if else
3- elif ladder
4- nested if else

"""

age=int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age>18:
    print("You are eligible to drive")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to drive")


"""
The abpve mentioned is simplest example of if else statements. But here are few important points to remember:
* colon (:) is part of syntax and it is must for you to place it correctly
* if part will always take logical or comparison operator
* indentation(spacing) is required to enter in a certain if or else block
